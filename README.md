# Developer-Defined Accelerations in Continuous Integration: A Detection Approach and Catalog of Patterns

> [!NOTE]
> This replication package has been tested on amd64 architecture with Ubuntu 24.04 operating system.

## Replication
Our dataset is very large (about 1TB uncompressed, ~100GB compressed). We did not find a hosting service which can host such large files while keep anonymous during the review process. Hence, our dataset is available on request. This repository contains the inspection results.

### Setup

1. The following steps have been tested on a venilla Ubuntu Server 24.04 system. If you use other operating systems, be aware that your environment may differ from the authors', so adjust the relative command when necessary.
2. Install Docker. The recommended way is to use the script:


### RQ1
#### Manual Inspection
The samples and inspection results are in the `rq1_inspection.xlsx` file. The file `rq1_inspection_agreed.csv` is for computer processing (evaluating performance, counting agreement, etc.).

#### Evaluation
First, download the files in `src` folder. Then, install [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) (.NET 8.0 is preferred).

Locate to `src/BuildAcceleration/BuildAcceleration` folder, and run `dotnet run -- -h`.

- To calculate clusters and ratios, run `dotnet run -- cluster` (this requires the dataset, which is available on request).
- To detect accelerated jobs by rules, run `dotnet run -- detect` (this also requires the dataset).

However, the results of clustering `KMeansCluster.csv` and `KMeansClusterRatio.csv` are placed in the replication folder. The results of detection `ruled_detection.csv` is also placed.

### RQ2 
#### Detection
To detect accelerated jobs, run `dotnet run -- cluster --all` and `dotnet run -- detect --all` (requires dataset). This produces `k-means_all.csv` and `ruled_detection.csv`. Then manually (using Excel) select detected jobs based on the threshold.

#### Manual Inspection
The inspection results are in the `rq2_classification.xlsx` file. The file `rq2_Final Labels.csv` is for computer processing.

#### Processing (Converting labels to patterns)
As described in the paper, the labels are full sentences. To convert it to pattern names, first, put the following files:

- `rq2_Final Labels.csv` to `Desktop/build_accel/Final Labels.csv`.
- `KMeansClusterRatio.csv` to `Desktop/build_accel/KMeansClusterRatio.csv`.
- `rq1_inspection_agreed.csv` to `Desktop/build_accel/inspection_agreed.csv`.

Then, run `dotnet run -- count-categories`. The results will appear in `Desktop/build_accel` folder. Note that we did further modifications to the category and pattern names, so there might be a very slight difference from the names in the paper.
